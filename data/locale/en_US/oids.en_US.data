2.16.840.1.113883.6.18,IB,ISBT 128 is a coding system for blood components\, hematopoietic progenitor cells and other tissues. It is comprised of an overall Application Specification\, and labeling and coding documents for the separate sections: blood components\, hematopoietic progenitor cells (draft)\, source plasma (draft) and tissues (draft). The documentation is supported by databases: Country/Collection Facility\, Product Code (blood components)\, Product Code (hematopoietic progenitor sells)\, Product Code (source plasma)\, Product Code (tissues) and Special Testing. ISBT 128 is designed as a series of data structures that are designed to be technology-independent and can be used for bar coding\, radio frequency tag encoding and electronic data interchange. The HL7 Blood Bank SIG is currently designing example messages that incorporate ISBT 128 coding. No changes of any kind will be needed to use ISBT 128 in HL7 messages.,Complete

2.16.840.1.113883.6.20,NDA,The terminology consists of standardized terms and codes for patient problems or life processes expressed as nursing diagnoses. These data elements would be classified by HL7 as �observations�. The taxonomy is  multi-axial. It consists of 12 domains and 36 classes. All domains and classes are defined. There are 7 axes with definitions for each. Each nursing diagnosis consists of: a concept label or term expressed as a noun or a noun phrase; a definition of the term; a set of defining characteristics (signs and symptoms) of the diagnostic term; an approved list of modifiers of the term; a set of risk factors with definitions; and a set of related factors (or etiologies) for the term.  The system preserves semantics by having robust review procedures and policies to ensure against semantic drift in the meanings of the encoded terms over time. NANDA as an organization is committed to updating the terminology on a regular biannual basis.  NANDA has been in existence since 1973 and is thus the oldest developer of standardized language in nursing. Most other nursing language systems use many of the older NANDA terms in their vocabularies. The express purpose of the organization is to develop a comprehensive standardized nursing language that captures the conclusions that nurses make based on observations � in effect\, the nursing diagnoses. The work is a continuing effort and diagnoses are revised\, retired or added bi-annually. The codes are simple integers and are not linked to each other. If a diagnostic term is retired\, the code is also retired. If a new diagnosis is added a new code is given to that term. If a diagnostic term is revised\, the code is kept intact but the date of the revision is published alongside the term. Domains and classes are not coded.,Complete

See Tables 1-3 for the elements and related definitions organized by each categories.  The NMMDS most appropriately focuses at the first level of accountability for patient/client/family/community nursing care: this may be the delivery unit\, service\, or center of excellence level.  The NMMDS supports numerous constructed variables as well as aggregation of data at the unit\, institution\, network\, and system\, etc levels.
